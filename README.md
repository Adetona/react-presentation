## React Presentation

This is a presentation about [reactjs](https://facebook.github.io/react/), built with reactjs and the use of [spectacle](http://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle/). It uses interactive examples to actually live demo the code without ever leaving the presentation. This is still a work in progress and feedback/contributions are welcome. The basic stuff I have put in for this so far is heavily based off [this post](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/elevator-pitch-react/).

I currently have the presentation live at [http://standayweb.github.io/react-presentation](http://standayweb.github.io/react-presentation). You can press alt+p to go into presenter mode and see the notes.

Next I was thinking of adding some slides going deeper into the virtual dom and diffing and some of the other reasons react is good and probably something about the community and how popular react is getting. Also I need to go back over the examples and notes to see if there is any improvements I can make.
